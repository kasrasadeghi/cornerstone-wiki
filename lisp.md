The Lisp family of languages brings meta-programming closest to first-class
compiler parity, and languages in the Lisp family often do this by marrying
compile-time and run-time, which has its own set of consequences.

TODO compare lisp macros with texps
TODO - describe why they're hard to debug
TODO - describe how they interact with libraries
TODO - describe lisp-1 and lisp-2 affect macros and hygiene
TODO - describe how eval affects the tower of interpretation
TODO - describe how the lack of tags harms verification and composition
TODO - describe how composition and subsexps is affected by representation
TODO   - representation and tags are related
