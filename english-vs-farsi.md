| English vs Farsi: An Anecdote on Language Complexity |
\------------------------------------------------------/

At some point in the past, I was comparing the two languages I know: Farsi, my
mother tongue; and English, my most comfortable language.  English has a very
complicated grammar with a good number of special cases, tenses, inflection, and
idiomatic preposition usage.  Thus the study of the English grammar is common
amongst even native English speakers.  For a large part of schooling in English
speaking countries, the study of grammar permeates the study of the language.

On the hand, in Farsi, a non-native speaker can learn the grammar of Farsi
within a couple semesters of college-level classes.  The vast majority of verb
conjugations are extremely regular and the language has a small number of
prepositions.  In Iran, my parents recollect few classes or lessons about the
grammar of Farsi.  Much of the time spent studying Farsi is spent studying
literature: reading, reciting, and memorizing poetry and historical epics.  Many
native Farsi speakers I have asked don't recall a word for grammar; the closest
analogue is "dastoor-e zaban", or the "rules for language".

This is not a proof of any proposition about language and grammar, but merely
the source of my inspiration for this line of thinking.

- [Language Structure is Partly Determined by Social
  Structure](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0008559)
  about: languages spoken by a large number of L2 speakers are more likely to
  reduce the usage of inflectional morphology and rely on analytic lexical
  constructions
  - k: it may be the case that non-synthetic language constructions are easier
    to understand
    - maybe they're more regular and have less exceptions due to pronounciation
